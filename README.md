### Oblig 3 Webprogramming

In this project we were tasked with making a trivial web application for purchasing movie tickets. 

The application uses Spring API for communication between client and server. 

The data is stored in a relation database using H2 Database. 

I have not paid any attention to input validation in this project, since it was not asked of us. Regex for input validation was a topic later in the course.
