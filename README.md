### Oblig 3 Webprogramming

In this project we were tasked with making a trivial web application for purchasing movie tickets. The client is writen in JS/HTML and is styled using Bootstrap. The server is writen in Java, with spring dependency.

The application uses Spring API for communication between client and server. 

The data is stored in a relation database using H2 Database SQL. 



I have not paid any attention to input validation in this project, since it was not asked of us. Regex for input validation was a topic later in the course.
